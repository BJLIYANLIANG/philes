# Philes

Philes is a decentralized notepad or possibly google docs. It allows you to read and write content to IPFS in a decentralized fashion.

Philes also supports collaborative editing with many peers on the same document.

This project should still be considered work in progress...

## Origin of the name
Philes commonly refer to files about hacking in the days of BBSs. The use of ph in lieu of f is an homage to the word phone.

Phrack has a hacker magazine back in the day. Its issues were released irregularly, and like academic publications issues were grouped into volumes. Each issue was comprised of a number of Philes: stand-alone text files of very technical or counter-cultural content. Philes were submitted by members of the hacker underground community, and were reviewed by the editors.

## Demo
